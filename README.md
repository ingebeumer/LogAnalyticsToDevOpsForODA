As an Administrator, I want to have the findings and recommendations of an On-Demand Assessment in Azure DevOps Work Items so that I can work with On-Demand Assessment remediation as with any other Work Item in my organization.

The result of this tutorial allows for easier tracking of remediation progress of On-Demand Assessment conform the Agile working method in your organization. Tracking progress on what the team is working on then on also conforms to your Agile working method.

The tutorial does not go further into concepts of Scrum and Agile methodologies nor how to apply the Scrum Framework with Boards in Azure DevOps. The focus is on doing more with less, on gaining automation savings and keeping developers and administrators focused on high-impact and not administrative work. To empower every developer and every organization to achieve more with their data. 

You will learn how to:

## 1 - Export from Log Analytics workspace
We start by exporting On-Demand Assessment findings and recommendations from the Log Analytics workspace.

1.	In the Azure portal select the specific [Log Analytics workspace](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.OperationalInsights%2Fworkspaces) from which you want to export.
1.	Select **Logs** in the workspace menu.

    ![Screenshot of partial menu in Log Analytics workspace to navigate to Logs.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211514234-3eb0fa29-33ef-44be-95fc-de1bdb85ad5b.png)

1.	Close the Queries window.

    ![Screenshot of closing the Queries window.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211514249-a22c2050-becb-4e65-9532-2fa97ed777bc.png)

### 1.1 - Assessment Name
On-Demand Assessment names differ per product. To export from the assessment you are interested in, you need the name. 
1.	Copy the KQL query (Kusto Query Language) to Log Analytics workspace > Logs.
	   ```kusto
    //Assessment
    search *
    | where $table contains "Assessment"
    | summarize by $table
    | project $table
    ```
    
1.	Select **Run** to get the assessment name. 
If thereâ€™s no immediate result, change the **Time range**; the default schedule to run On-Demand Assessments is weekly, but the default time range for KQL is the last 24 hours. 

This example results to SQLAssessmentRecommendation.

![Screenshot of KQL query with a 24 hours time range showing 1 result.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211517173-16d3f0c0-36a6-4ad3-a1d8-3bf1a0eb9222.png)
![Screenshot of KQL query with a 7 days time range showing 3 results.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211517206-980548ad-c707-4680-ba0e-88f3c8050ba6.png)
 
### 1.2 - Export Focus Area
Start by exporting the Focus Areas.
1. Copy below KQL query to Log Analytics workspace > Logs. 
1. Select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to search for `<MyAssessmentRecommendation>` and replace this with the result from the Assessment Name query.
1. Adjust query parameter **qpAssignTo** and replace `<MyFullName>` by your full name as shown in Azure DevOps. 
    ![Screenshot of KQL query and modifications needed before running the query.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211526368-79e47bc9-ac49-468d-81e4-8efd5ff87013.png)
1. Adjust the **Time range** if you are on the default schedule to run On-Demand Assessments weekly.
    ```kusto
	   //Focus Area
	   declare query_parameters (
	        qpAssignTo: string = "<MyFullName>" //your full name as shown in Azure DevOps
	   );
	   //
	   <MyAssessmentRecommendation> //replace with result from Query Assessment Name
	   | where (RecommendationResult == "Failed")
	   | summarize by AssessmentName, FocusArea
	   | project 
	        ID = ' '
	        , ['Work Item Type'] = 'Epic'
	        , ['Assigned To'] = qpAssignTo
	        , ['Title 1'] = strcat('On-Demand Assessment for ', AssessmentName, ' | ', FocusArea)
	        , ['Title 2'] = ''
	        , Description = strcat('Epic imported from "On-Demand Assessment for ', AssessmentName, '" and Focus Area "', FocusArea
	        , '" in Log Analytics workspace.')
	        , Priority = 2;
	   //**Export | Export to CSV - displayed columns**.
	   //Rename _query_data.csv_ to _1_Epic.csv_
    ```

1. Select **Run** the query to get the Focus Area that will transform to Epics. 
1. Export the results to csv through **Export | Export to CSV - displayed columns**.
1. Rename _query_data.csv_ to _1_Epic.csv_.
1. If you reorder columns or change the sort order in the csv files, the later import in Azure DevOps may break or have unexpected results.

This example results from items found in the On-Demand Assessment for SQL.
    ![Screenshot of running the KQL query for Focus Area and Exporting the results to CSV.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211526439-91deac6d-9e32-4466-aaa5-4939ff85ac84.png)

### 1.3 - Export findings and recommendations
Like the export of Focus Area, we export findings and recommendations.
1. Copy below KQL query to Log Analytics workspace > Logs. 
1. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to search for `<MyAssessmentRecommendation>` and replace this with the result from the Assessment Name query.
1. Adjust query parameter **qpAssignTo** and replace `<MyFullName>` by your full name as shown in Azure DevOps. 
1. If needed adjust query parameter **qpWorkItemType** and replace **Product Backlog Item** by your Work Item Type as confirmed in Azure DevOps project process.
1. Adjust the **Time range** if you are on the default schedule to run On-Demand Assessments weekly.
    ```kusto
    //Findings and recommendations
    declare query_parameters (
        qpAssignTo: string = "<MyFullName>" //your full name as shown in Azure DevOps.
        , qpWorkItemType: string = "Product Backlog Item" //Work Item Type as in your Azure DevOps project process.
    );
    //
    <MyAssessmentRecommendation>
    | where (RecommendationResult == "Failed")
    | where not (FocusArea has_any("InternalAssessmentQuality", "Prerequisite"))
    | summarize by AssessmentName, FocusArea
    | project 
        ID = '<EpicID>'
        , ['Work Item Type'] = 'Epic'
        , ['Assigned To'] = qpAssignTo
        , ['Title 1'] = strcat('On-Demand Assessment for ', AssessmentName, ' | ', FocusArea)
        , ['Title 2'] = ''
        , Description = strcat('Epic imported from "On-Demand Assessment for ', AssessmentName, '" and Focus Area "', FocusArea, '" in Log Analytics workspace.')
        , Priority = 2
        , tmpFocusArea = FocusArea
    | union (
        <MyAssessmentRecommendation>
        | where (RecommendationResult == "Failed")
        | where not (FocusArea has_any("InternalAssessmentQuality", "Prerequisite"))
        | summarize by AssessmentName, FocusArea, Recommendation, Description, RecommendationScore
        | sort by FocusArea, Recommendation
        | project 
            ID = ' '
            , ['Work Item Type'] = qpWorkItemType
            , ['Assigned To'] = qpAssignTo
            , ['Title 1'] = ''
            , ['Title 2'] = Recommendation
            , Description
            , RecommendationScore
            , tmpFocusArea = FocusArea
        | extend Priority = //convert RecommendationScore in On-Demand Assessment to Priority in Azure DevOps
            iif(RecommendationScore >= 30, 1, iif(RecommendationScore >= 20, 2, iif(RecommendationScore >= 10, 3, iif(RecommendationScore >= 0, 4, 4))))
        | project-away RecommendationScore
        )
    | sort by tmpFocusArea asc, ['Work Item Type'] asc 
    | project-away tmpFocusArea;
    //**Export | Export to CSV - displayed columns**.
    //Rename _query_data.csv_ to _2_ProductBacklogItem.csv_
    ```
1. Select **Run** the query to get the findings and recommendations that will transform to product backlog items.
1. Export the results to csv through **Export | Export to CSV - displayed columns**.
1. Rename _query_data.csv_ to _2_ProductBacklogItems.csv_.
1. If you reorder columns or change the sort order in the csv files, the later import in Azure DevOps may break or have unexpected results.

This example results from items found in the On-Demand Assessment for SQL.

## 2 - Import into Azure DevOps
Now the export is complete, we can import Azure DevOps Epics and Product Backlog Items.
### 2.1 - Import Epics
1. Go to your [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) project and select the **Queries** menu item on the left.

    ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps menu to navigate to Queries.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211528944-f36255bd-8b1d-4973-abb7-b060633cd456.png)
 
1. In the top menu select **Import Work Items**.

    ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps Queries to Import Work Items.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211529193-6b36e5e4-668f-4156-b6fd-7ef28a211a99.png)

1. On the right select **Choose File**. Navigate to _1_Epic.csv_ and select **Import**.

    ![Screenshot of choosing your csv file to import into Azure DevOps.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211529308-1ad956f5-3c7c-4263-b63d-042ffc58a4dc.png)

1. Review the imported items to see if there are no data issues highlighted that you need to resolve before you can **Save items**.

    ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps Import Work Items to confirm there are no items highlighted before you can Save items.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211529360-db545e6a-ad53-410a-af22-00fa5d29a2de.png)

1.  Keep the screen open because you need the Epic IDs in a minute.

### 2.2 - Import Product Backlog Items
1. If you donâ€™t have the screen open with the Epics you just created, go to your [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) project and **Recently created** in **Work items**.

    ![Screenshot of how to Save items in Azure DevOps that were just imported.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211529610-9b467733-5300-4617-8f15-e50da37b52d7.png)

1. First, you need to prepare file _2_ProductBacklogItems.csv_ for import in Azure DevOps.
1. Open file _2_ProductBacklogItems.csv_.
1. For each row in file _2_ProductBacklogItems.csv_ where Work Item Type equals Epic, replace the placeholder text `<EpicID>` by the ID from the Azure DevOps Epics we just imported and paste it in the row with the same Epic title in _2_ProductBacklogItems.csv_.

    ![Screenshot of csv file in Excel with highlighted rows of Work Item Type equals Epic. Overlay of Azure DevOps imported and saved Epics with the ID column highlighted to copy the ID to the matching row in the csv file.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211529781-07d067d5-42f0-4e6d-ba19-1ab002850239.png)

1. Save and close file _2_ProductBacklogItems.csv_.
1. Return to **Import Work Items** in the **Queries** menu item in the left in Azure DevOps.
1. Select **Import Work Items**.

    ![Screenshot of how to Import Work Items in Queries in Azure DevOps.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40343254/211529900-3e2be81d-3179-4a6a-915a-b5f8f90feac1.png)

1. On the right **Choose File**. Navigate to file _2_ProductBacklogItems.csv_ and select **Import**.
1. Review the imported items to see if there are no data issues highlighted that you need to resolve before you can continue. Depending on the number of error messages either remediate manually in Azure DevOps or change in file _2_ProductBacklogItems.csv_ and restart the import.

> **Warning**
> 
> Example with import errors where the name in the csv file does not match an identity in Azure DevOps to assign Work Items to. For a successful import, you need to resolve errors and warnings.

###Clean up resources
When no longer needed, delete the csv files generated earlier.

### Next Steps
Next you can work on On-Demand Assessment remediation in Azure DevOps as you would with any other Work Item in your Agile working method.
